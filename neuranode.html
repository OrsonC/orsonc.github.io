      <h4>The Gist</h4>
      <p>Neuranode was created with a science-interested youth in mind.
        At its core, Neuranode is intended to be a social media application
        much more rooted into science than existing contemporaries. It was
        to preserve all the functions of an engaging social media platform
        while providing a scientific edge to it. I sought to create an
        experience that mimicked existing social media applications so as
        to not create a steep learning curve in learning to use the app,
        and instead would allow the user to learn more about the science
        aspect of the app. I sought to curate an experience that was not
        daunting to handle while placing an explicit focus on the science
        (the neuranode graphic as explained below), using daily questions
        that would build the user's evolving profile to keep users engaged
        consistently.</p>

    <!-- Problems Panel -->
    <div class="probPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Problems</h4>
      <p>Visualization of data within the world of scientific literature is
        oftentimes atrocious and illegible to those without a working prior
        knowledge of the field in discussion. Combine that with the
        complexities of creating a social app with comprehensive and
        intuitive UI, the task almost seems ridiculous to tackle. Between
        the multitudinous functions that must be included to make the app
        worthwhile and the scientific data to be visualised, it is easy to
        lose a user.<br><br>The challenge I tackled was creating not only an
        interface that would be easy to navigate, but also be able to
        represent the scientific data behind it. I wanted the user to know
        exactly what could be interacted with, while also be able to absorb
        the scientific information that was provided to them. Lastly, as with
        most successful social media apps, I wanted the user to consistently
        return to the app itself.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">

    </div>

    <!-- Solutions Panel -->
    <div class="solPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Solutions</h4>
      <p>The issues above stem primarily from two types of problems, the first
        being from within the interface itself, and the second being from the
        scientific subject matter.<br><br>The tough subject matter was solved
        primarily through graphic design means by designing a meaningful way to
        represent the results of a Myers Briggs test.<br><br>To create an
        interface that was usable and comprehensive, I chose to stick with the
        tried and tested Jakob's Law, and modeled much of the interactions on
        existing social media apps. I split the app into three separate screens
        based off of their functions, and supplemented the interface with a set of
        icons designed for ease of use. To encourage the user to visit the app
        more consistently, I created a system where the app would give the user
        a way to build upon their profile daily to reflect their changing
        personalities through use of a daily question.</p>

    <!-- Experience Flow Panel -->
    <div class="xpfPanel">
      <h4>Experience Flow</h4>
      <p>No one enjoys approaching a social media app with the amount of brain
        power it does to approach scientific literature, and as such I opted to
        make the experience as streamlined as possible.<br><br>Long set up
        processes are no fun to anyone, so I set the app to run a super cursory
        Myers Briggs test, which could be stopped at anytime. This was also done
        to allow users to get into the heart of the experience as fast as
        possible. Much like people change (or grow, as we prefer to call it), we
        wanted the profile of the person to evolve with the person. With each
        day, the user could answer a daily question out of the database of
        questions we had, and it would then build onto the existing profile of
        the user.</p>

    <!-- Neuranode Graphic Panel -->
    <div class="imgPanel">
      <h4>The Neuranode Graphic</h4>
      <p>The idea of the neuranode  was to create a sort of barcode for a person's
        current personality profile. The base of the neuranode is split into four
        two-part quadrants, with each quadrant representing each dichotomy
        presented by the Myers Briggs results (introversion/extraversion,
        intuition/sensing, feeling/thinking, perception/judgment). As users take
        tests, point values are assigned for each answer provided to the category
        they answer (for example, an answer asking about the i/e dichotomy could
        net a result of 0/3 in each respective section), and nodes would be added
        according to the point value a user had in each section. Random locations
        were selected to place the nodes, and an algorithm was made to create the
        organic path traveling between the nodes.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Icon Set Panel -->
    <div class="icnPanel">
      <h4>Icon Set</h4>
      <p>I created a set of icons and UI components for the app to ensure adherence
        to the design that I wanted. Every single button that can be interacted with
        is first and foremost with rounded edges, and secondly colored in the
        lighter blue <span id="nnBlue">(#3D94C6)</span>. Those used for the
        main functions (taking a photo, answering a question, closing a dialogue
        window, etc.), boxed here in red, were given a solid body, while those used
        to navigate between pages, boxed here in yellow, were given a hollow outline.
        Secondary screen elements (such as frames and panel boxes) are colored a
        teal <span id="nnTeal">(#1f838c)</span> to highlight areas of
        interest.</p>
