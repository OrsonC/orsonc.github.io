      <p>This website, my UI/UX portfolio, is an extension of my <a href="http://www.orsonchengdesign.com/"
        target="_blank"><span class="boldp">graphic design portfolio</span></a>.
        While I originally had most of my UI/UX content as a section
        on my graphic design site, I wasn't too pleased with the limited amount of
        control I had over the specifics of the portfolio site that I had created
        through SquareSpace. I decided that there would be no better way to
        present my work within this field while also showcasing my skills through
        creating my own website from scratch, and this is the result.</p>

      <p>Not that it really matters to anybody, but I'm really super proud of my
        work on this portfolio site!<br><br>I took the things I didn't like about using a
        pre-made template, looked through how to make it something I would be happy
        with, and executed upon this vision. I went through a full process from
        identifying what I disliked about what was available, sorting through
        different solutions, drafting up ways to incorporate the solutions into
        my product, testing the different layouts to see which ones were optimal
        for what I intended, to finally bringing forth and publishing something
        that I'm super happy with.<br><br>This is definitely still a work in progress,
        but I'm glad that I took the time to learn what I did and go through the design
        process to create this site!</p>

    <!-- Problems Panel -->
    <div class="probPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Problems</h4>
      <p>As a portfolio site, the main intention for the product is to keep the
        user engaged and ready to view more of my work, while keeping the
        information accessible and digestible. I needed to be able to present my
        work in a manner that would not be overwhelming to take in, yet still
        expressed enough about my work to be informative about my design process.
        <br><br>A major factor that motivated me to create this site was the
        problems that I experienced with my <a href="http://www.orsonchengdesign.com/" target="_blank">
        <span class="boldp">SquareSpace portfolio</span></a>. Control over
        individual elements was very limited, and as a result, I had a hard time
        creating moments of interaction that were meaningful and delightful to the
        user. I had to go through and devise a strict system to try to inform users
        of interactables and links, and had no ability to have my images animate as
        I desired. The navigation was also quite terrible once the minimal breakpoint
        for the navigation was reached. I would be able to pull up a side menu for
        my navigation, but the content screen would be locked into place until the
        side menu went away. These problems informed me of many design choices that
        I chose to make in creating this current site, seeking to create something
        that wouldn't cause the problems to the user that my other portfolio did.
        <br><br>The main problems I had when creating this site was keeping the
        information in parcels that were easy to take in, while keeping the
        experience of navigating the site enjoyable and unimpeding.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">

    </div>

    <!-- Solutions Panel -->
    <div class="solPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Solutions</h4>
      <p>To handle the above problems, I thought the best thing to do was to cut
        straight to the point with my content. I created the site to feature my
        work heavily on the home page, and have it be the dominant element on the
        landing page for my website. To keep navigation crisp, I kept the
        important pages available at all times in a navigation bar at the top, and
        employed shapes that cut diagonally across the screen to create interest
        in the process of scrolling through the page. The diagonals also serve a
        secondary purpose in informing the user of additional content on screens
        where the scene may appear complete in the viewport at first sight. Lastly,
        to keep navigation easy, I had all the elements that can be interacted
        with behave in the same way within the system I had applied to the site,
        having all the links change to a red color on hover.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Experience Flow Panel -->
    <div class="xpfPanel">
      <h4>Experience Flow</h4>
      <p>I wanted the experience of visiting my portfolio site to be intuitive
        and require minimal explanation. As such, the diagonal elements serve an
        important purpose. These diagonal lines peek at the edges of the welcome
        and contact information screens, encouraging users to scroll into them
        to find out what content is available there. I also wanted to put in a
        lot of little moments of delight, and assigned a system of animations
        that would occur in response to user interaction. This is primarily used
        to inform users of what can be interacted with, and to keep users
        interested in venturing forth into what the interactions led to. Lastly,
        I opted to have a navigation bar present at all times because there is a
        lot of content to parse through for each project, and having the navigation
        options be only available at the top of every document would cause for
        a lot of frustration.<br><br>As can be seen from these experience flow
        diagrams, I intended for all the pages to be closely linked to each other
        to create ease of navigation. Each page is never more than a click away
        from any other page, and this interconnectednedd is supplemented by the
        navigation bar at the top of every page and the links to the projects at
        the bottom of all the project pages.</p>

    <!-- Flash Card Graphic Panel -->
    <div class="imgPanel">
      <h4>Visual Design System</h4>
      <p>The underlying idea behind the visual design system of my portfolio site
        was to create a clear hierarchy of what was going on. I focused on the
        material of the site, looking at how to more accurately portray the
        different layers that went into the site.<br><br>Obviously, there had to
        be the most flexible and clear layer at the very top, as it was necessary
        for displaying my content. I had a specific red I had in mind <span class="red">
        (#DC4949)</span> that was a carry over from my graphic design portfolio, and I
        had that selected as the highlight color on my site for all my links and
        text of emphasis. Beneath this top layer, I had decided on alternating
        between two different styles of layers, one being a pattern of bright
        color blocks, and the other being images with a little bit of chromatic
        aberration. The color pattern is built with polygons of seven different colors,
        an orange <span id="ocOrange">(#FBA919)</span>, a yellow <span id="ocYellow">(#FCEE21)</span>,
        a green <span id="ocGreen">(#6DBE45)</span>, a blue <span id="ocBlue">(#5CB2E4)</span>,
        a teal <span id="ocTeal">(#64C6BD)</span>, a pink <span id="ocPink">(#D94779)</span>,
        and a purple <span id="ocPurple">(#69297C)</span>.<br><br>To further emphasize the idea of layers within the
        site, I had my images be presented on cards that would slide into the
        pages they were on (much like paper or card stock does). I introduced a
        parallax scrolling effect to my home screen to create a further emphasis
        on the layers involved in my site as well, and employed shadows to make
        clear that the navigation bar was a layer on top of the content of my pages.</p>

    <div class="icnPanel">
      <h4>Interactive Elements</h4>
      <p>For this page, I designed a system that can be seen in the style guide
        for interactive objects. When seen on mobile and tablet devices (which I set
        to be anything with a viewport under 1280px across), these elements are highlighted with the color
        of red <span class="red">(#DC4949)</span>. On a computer, these interactive elements
        are animated upon a mouse hover as a response to the user.<br><br>When links are
        available in text, the text is written in boldface, and turn red on hover.<br>On
        mobile, the text is in boldface and red.</p>
      <div class="ocdDemo">
        <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
          <p>This is a <span class="boldp">demo for linked text</span>.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>When images were the carriers of links, hovering the image produced a caption
        that would gather/drop into the image. This caption would be produced with white
        text on a red field, with the opacity lowered to allow for visibility of the
        image it covered.<br>On mobile, the caption and a field of red is overlayed over
        the image.</p>
      <div class="ocdDemo">
        <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
          <div class="ocdImgDemo" data-title="Linked Image Demo"
            data-capt="The hover produces this response.">
            <img src="image/ocd/imgDemo.jpg" />
          </div>
          <div class="mobileCapt" id="imgDemoCapt">
            <p>This is a description of the image.</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>Icons reacted differently yet. I created a small library of icons to use for
        my page, namely for the purpose of navigating between my different profiles. These
        icons would grow in size upon hover, and see its graphic change to a descriptive
        caption.<br>On mobile, the graphic icon is used with a caption beneath to denote
        its destination.</p>
      <div class="ocdDemo">
        <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
          <div class="ocdIconDemo">
            <img src="image/mtIcon.png" />
          </div>
          <div class="mobileCapt">
            <p>ICON<br>DESCRIPTION</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
