      <h4>The Gist</h4>
      <p>My buddy and I made Hoop Bank for those who did not like the clutter of
        existing sport databases (such as myself). While I do not argue that there
        are a lot of stats that need to be expressed in the realm of sports and
        athletes, the core statistics of a basketball player are very rudimentary
        and need little embellishment. Especially in the setting of a fantasy
        draft, information such as the year of the player's debut or their home
        town hold no weight in the decision process, and as such, I wanted to
        create a streamlined, no-nonsense process that would lead the users to the
        stats as fast as possible.</p>

      <h4>UI/UX Problems</h4>
      <p>As both big fans of basketball and the NBA, my friend Alex and I follow
        the players and teams to keep track of how each player and team is doing.
        The problem with this is, the official source of data where one can track
        this, <a href="https://www.nba.com/" target="_blank"><span class="boldp">
        NBA.com</span></a>, struggles with putting the barebones numbers for the stats
        of a player across multiple seasons, and even teams. As a result, we set
        forth to create a tool for those looking to find a straightforward and
        clean way of looking up these statistics for a player or for players of a
        team.<br><br>The problems that came with this was condensing a difficult
        process that involved a lot of information into a condensed and
        streamlined experience for the user.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">

    <!-- Solutions Panel -->
    <div class="solPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Solutions</h4>
      <p>To create a streamlined process for the user, a large part of the work
        was put into creating the database behind the web app. Creating a cohesive
        foundation in the information architecture was the grounds for creating an
        intuitive flow of information for the user to intake, and once that was
        figured out, I merely sought to minimise the extra, unnecessary steps in
        between. I start the user's process with a simple search, and then allow
        the teams and players to be linked to each other within a single click.
        The rest was simply applying a design system that would emphasize the
        important stats that the user wanted, and the items that could be
        interacted with.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Experience Flow Panel -->
    <div class="xpfPanel">
      <h4>Experience Flow</h4>
      <p>For our application, we sought to create a fluid process that was
        intuitive for users to look up statistics. In a clutch situation where
        fantasy drafts are on the line, nobody wants to be sitting around
        perusing through walls of text to find the information that they need.
        I wanted the experience of using the application to be simple and
        straightforward, allowing for ease of navigation between places that the
        user might want to see.<br><br>The user starts the experience at the
        landing page, with nothing to interact with other than the search bar.
        A search can be for a player or for a team, and be it the former, the
        user is led to the table fo stats for the player. Should the user search
        for the latter, or select the team on the player page they landed on,
        the user is led to a screen with a list of the active players on the
        team's roster. The two types of pages are always just a click away from
        each other, so as to streamline the process.</p>

    <!-- Flash Card Graphic Panel -->
    <div class="imgPanel">
      <h4>Visual Design System</h4>
      <p>Visually, I wanted the visuals to focus on the important information -
        the numbers. The numbers are the largest text on screen aside from the
        player/team name.<br><br>As type is the meat of the content, I put a lot
        of the emphasis on the designing on how the type was used. I selected from
        the red/white/blue palette of the NBA, and designated the red <span id="hbRed">
        (#b62025)</span> to be used for text that would link to other pages.
        Blue <span id="hbBlue">(#0062ab)</span> is reserved for informative
        text, such as what a number denotes (is this "13.8" the average for the
        points, rebounds, or assists?) and the name of the currently searched
        player or team.</p>

    <!-- Icon Set Panel -->
    <div class="icnPanel">
      <h4>The Database</h4>
      <p>We designed the database schema to be one in which the user could navigate
        between the two types of data (players and teams) with ease. Seen here in
        the UML diagram, the player has an identifying ID (pid) integer, and has
        fields for the player's name (pname), position (position), and jersey number
        (number). The team has two fields, one for the team's identifying number (tid),
        and the other for the team's name (tname). The "player_stats_by_year,"
        displayed within the "players" page on the app, then provides different stats
        for the player by displaying which pid to display for and for which tid the
        player's numbers were for, and having the stats show for each field
        (points/rebounds/assists). Under the "teams" pages on the app, the "roster"
        contains the field tid to know which team to display for, and a pid to display.
        <br><br>On the side you will find the "users" table. This table was meant
        expressly for admins of the console to manually insert, delete, or update
        existing tables within the database.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
        <img src="image/hb/schema.png" />
      </div>
      <p>Interfacing with the databse can be done for two types of users, the admin
        or the general user. The general user submits a form for their search query,
        and is able to receive their desired information or follow links to other pages.
        The admin is able to update the database, either by modifying existing entries,
        or adding/deleting entries.</p>
