      <h4>The Gist</h4>
      <p>VIEWS is an ongoing project that I started with my buddy Shixin Nie.
        VIEWS was designed as a game that would respect the players'
        intelligence and nothhold the player's hands throughout the gameplay. To
        accomplish this, I stripped away all forms of UI or UX that I deemed
        unnecessary to learning the game, instead striving to teach the mechanics
        of the game through elements embedded within the game itself (such as the
        visual and sound assets found within the game). VIEWS was made to provide
        an experience that would nurture players into finding the eureka moment
        while playing the game without intrusively bombarding the players with
        instructions. The game has since been showcased at the

      <h4>UI/UX Problems</h4>
      <p>There is a difficult-to-find "sweet spot" in the amount of instructions
        a game gives that makes the difficulty curve of the game just engaging
        enough to play, but not so difficult that players become aggravated and
        give up. In a game like this, where controls are relatively simple and
        the eureka moment comes in discovering the various puzzle mechanics of
        the game, I deemed it best to keep the hand-holding of the game to a
        minimal.<br><br>The toughest challenge in this project was creating a
        coherent experience that would achieve this effect, giving just enough
        guidance to the player without revealing too much.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Solutions Panel -->
    <div class="solPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Solutions</h4>
      <p>To create this coherent experience, I worked with multiple elements in
        the game itself to create the intended experience.<br><br>One of the key
        challenges to tackle was the level design itself. To produce a constant
        stream of satisfying challenges for the user to complete, we arranged to
        have the game introduce different game mechanics steadily as the player
        worked on honing their mastery over ones they knew already.<br><br>In
        terms of the UI itself, I had a majority of the instructional HUDs
        stripped from the game, and created a system of color use to denote
        different types of interactions. I designed each element within the game
        with the purpose of not only aesthetically reinforcing the theme of a dream-like
        puzzle setting, but more importantly, to communicate differences to the
        user so that they may better understand how to interact with the game elements.
        I also chose to employ specific sounds to serve as non-visual cues for the
        players to understand different game events. Together, these factors served
        to create an experience that could better immerse the player into the
        dreamlike setting of the game while preserving the intended difficulty
        curve of the game.</p>

    <!-- Experience Flow Panel -->
    <div class="xpfPanel">
      <h4>Experience Flow</h4>
      <p>While the UI/UX solutions created solutions to solving the problems we
        had at every moment, the specific moments in the game were dictated by
        the levels that we introduced into the game itself. The introduction and
        review of the puzzles are integral to the user experience of the game's
        progression, and this level flow chart demonstrates exactly <em>how</em>
        the puzzles are introduced into the game.</p>

    <!-- Flash Card Graphic Panel -->
    <div class="imgPanel">
      <h4>Visual Design System</h4>
      <p>I designed each element that went into the game with the purpose of
        informing the user on different types of interactions. In the game, the
        player is not prompted through instructions when a new challenge arrives.
        Rather, elements in a new visual style are introduced, and the players are
        encouraged to experiment with these elements as they please.<br><br>
        For the most part, I sought to create simple visuals to give more
        emphasis to the visual aspect of the gameplay, and to assist in the
        logistical limitations of a two-person team. The master style guide for
        all the artistic direction of the game can be found in my
        <a href="http://www.orsonchengdesign.com/gameart/" target="_blank">
        <span class="boldp">graphic design site</span></a>, where all the elements
        and their visuals are explained in greater detail.<br><br>I designed the
        elements within the game to have specific colors and looks to denote their
        purpose. Regular, walkable platforms would be dark on the sides with a
        solid color on top, or light on the sides in the mirror world. Doors would
        lose the dark/light colored sides, and would instead be fully colored,
        while mirror portal blocks were made denoted by dark blocks with glowing
        edges. Adherence to the color and visual guides was integral to showing
        users when a new type of interaction was available, while providing a way
        to help users identify different methods of interaction with the game.<br>
        <br>Specifics to the visual system will be more understandable as
