      <p>硬篤! Nyeh Dao! was made with a young and disinterested audience in mind.
        <i>硬篤</i>, pronounced <i>nyeh dao</i>, is the term for "difficult"
        in my home of Taiwan's native <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Min" target="_blank">

        slowly being ousted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandarin_Chinese" target="_blank">
        <span class="boldp">Mandarin Chinese<span></a> in usage, and unfortunately,
        the Minnan language has been <a href="https://chhuttaichi.weebly.com/214882877127597354862804022833/1" target="_blank">
        <span class="boldp">documented<span></a> to be in <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Minnanyu-Taiwanese-Hokkien-decaying-in-Taiwan" target="_blank">

        Learning a language, while a valuable skill, is not always fun, especially
        one that is considered the language of the "older generation." Currently
        available resources on the language (quite understandably) feel like
        going through a bulky dictionary, and that tends to be something that puts
        people off. I sought to curate an experience that would make learning this
        language much more approachable to youth, and would be not only fun to
        look at, but also be an easy-to-navigate resource so as to not intimidate
        the audience.</p>

      <h4>UI/UX Problems</h4>
      <p>Inciting interest into a seemingly dead language is a task that differs
        based on the target audiences involved. Luckily for me, I know exactly
        which audiences I want to target - youth in Taiwan who have a preference
        for Mandarin. While there are databases of Taiwanese phrases in existence,
        many have yet to be ported to a digital platform, and those that have
        tend to be more of a reference tool rather than a tool to spark interest.
        <br><br>The main challenges that I was faced with was creating something
        without a steep entry curve that, unlike existing digital tools that serve
        the same purpose, could keep the user engaged.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">

    </div>

    <!-- Solutions Panel -->
    <div class="solPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Solutions</h4>
      <p>Approaching this problem was a two-step process in my eye. First, I had
        to cause interest in the material at hand, and second, I had to maintain
        the interest that the user had in the app to stay and learn more.<br><br>
        The solution for the first issue was resolved primarily through information
        architecture, as sorting out a quick and easy way to access the flash
        cards seemed to do the trick. There was no need for an account to be made,
        so I removed as many steps in the process as possible between launching
        the app to seeing the information. There is only the process of selecting
        which subject matter of cards to browse through before the user gets to
        the cards themselves.<br><br>The second issue was a little bit more
        difficult to address. For this, I brought a lot of my graphic design
        background in to design the material look of the screens. These screens
        were intended to be reminiscent of flash cards, so I typography to convey
        the important information fast (like flash cards), while having a similar
        feel in interaction (flipping motion). I added a lot of color and lively
        emojis to further add in maintaining the interest of the intended user.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Experience Flow Panel -->
    <div class="xpfPanel">
      <h4>Experience Flow</h4>
      <p>I selected a collection of phrases that I feel are translated or
        expressed from Mandarin to Minnan in a quirky and unexpected manner.
        I wanted to compile phrases that were noteworthily peculiar or funny
        to create a stronger impression on the user so as to spark interest
        (no one expects the shark to be translated to "stupid fish").<br><br>
        Designed to be engaging and unimposing, I sought to create an
        environment that was easy to navigate. Instead of having specific
        phrases in mind, the user is offered a selection of themes in the menu,
        after which they are led to an assorted deck of flashcards. I kept
        interaction as simple as possible to decrease the difficulty in using
        the app, with simple icons to denote the main interactions of: read
        current card aloud, go to next card, and return to previous card.</p>

    </div>

    <!-- Flash Card Graphic Panel -->
    <div class="imgPanel">
      <h4>Flash Card Designs</h4>
      <p>In cohesion with the intended experience behind using the app, I made
        sure that the basic layout of each of the phrase cards was as simple as
        possible. Each phrase card, though generously decorated with emojis,
        still placed heavy emphasis on the text itself. Outside of a strong
        textual element in the middle, there are a few icons used for navigation,
        placed in locations in relation to the central focus of the screen
        (the large text field in the center) that were intuitive to their
        function.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
        <img src="image/nd/flashCard1.png" />
      </div>
      <p>To draw the emphasis that the text needed, I selected a
        weighty font that was not obscured behind atrocious type embellishments
        and decorations. A heavy, non-decorative font was selected to complete
        the task. I put the quirky translation right in the middle with the
        heaviest font, forcing it to be the first thing users saw. I then placed
        the meaning of the phrase in Mandarin Chinese below it, and had an
        anglicized version of the pronunciation of the Minnan put on top.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
        <img src="image/nd/flashCard2.png" />
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Icon Set Panel -->
    <div class="icnPanel">
      <h4>Icon Set</h4>
      <p>As can be easily noticed, a major element of the visual design is based
        off a modern type of iconography called emojis. After extensive research
        into the great many varieties of emojis that exist in today's day and age,
        I selected the ones that would be relevant to the phrases I had picked,
        and set out to create emojis based off of what was existent. The most
        important thing during the creation process was making sure that the emojis
        would largely be confined into a square, making them much easier to handle
        when assembling the pattern for the background.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
        <img src="image/nd/icons.png" />
      </div>
      <p>The icon set itself is not super extensive, and features very simple
        graphics to denote the various actions the user may take. All the interactive
        icons are limited to be in black and white to contrast from the colorful elements
        of the flash cards, and are in circles with a caption over them to inform of
        their function.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
