      <h4>The Gist</h4>
      <p>Trubadour was designed with the disinterested younger generation in mind.
        As an ongoing project with <a href="https://www.greendoorlabs.com/" target= "_blank">
        <span class="boldp">Green Door Labs</span></a> to inspire people to read
        more poetry, Trubadour was designed to suggest poems to users based off of
        their currently logged interests. To instill interest in poetry, which
        oftentimes may be deemed dull, I wanted the audience to be able to
        quickly find poems that may be of interest to them. This meant a quick and
        non-intimidating process that would lead straight to the poem, and once
        there, an experience that would keep them engaged within the poetry
        itself. As such, I created an experience that would lead to the poetry
        fast, and would keep the user engaged within the loop of poetry as the
        program continued to learn about the user.</p>

      <h4>UI/UX Problems</h4>
      <p>The trend of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/06/25/living/poetry-dead-poet-laureate-herrera-feat/index.html" target="_blank">
        <span class="boldp">dwindling interest in poetry</span></a> is one that
        has been <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/04/24/poetry-is-going-extinct-government-data-show/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.5b86fed91699" target="_blank">
        <span class="boldp">well-documented</span></a>. With Trubadour, the whole
        idea was to create something that would not only engage the youth (yes,
        I'm using "youth") with poetry and inspire them to see how cool poetry can
        be, but also be able to keep the users engaged with the tool on a
        consistent basis. Starting with only an Excel sheet with fields populated
        with the metadata of the poems, this task required a lot of creative
        nudging but also allowed for a lot of room for me to work. While there are
        websites that exist where collections of poems exist, none are very
        interactive or very inviting to users without prior interest in poetry.
        Trubadour seeks to provide an alternative to that.<br><br>The problems
        that came with this project were to create a sleek interface that would
        assist in getting the user to the poems they wanted to see quickly, assist
        in generating interest in the poetry, and to bring the users consistently
        back into the experience.</p>

    <!-- Solutions Panel -->
    <div class="solPanel">
      <h4>UI/UX Solutions</h4>
      <p>To bring the users to the poetry that they wanted as quickly as possible,
        I designed a process to locate poems that would be of the users' interests,
        and that came in the form of the selection circle. This also served to
        help generate interest in the poetry, but to add to that, we are currently
        experimenting with adding an element to gamify the poems and to make the
        app experience a social one to share with friends. These elements would
        also aid in bringing the users back to the app again, creating a healthy
        cycle of a network of people sharing poems with each other.</p>

    <!-- Experience Flow Panel -->
    <div class="xpfPanel">
      <h4>Experience Flow</h4>
      <p>Trubadour is designed to allow for an inviting and undaunting
        experience to ease users into the world of poetry. The experience had to
        require low commitment and very minimal amounts of decision making. I
        didn't want the users to feel intimidated by a large amount of decisions
        to make or have too many distractions from the experience of the poem's
        text itself.<br><br>The crux of the experience, I felt, should be the
        reading of poetry itself. Here in these user flow maps, it can be seen how
        central the screens with poems on them are to the overall experience.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">

    <!-- Flash Card Graphic Panel -->
    <div class="imgPanel">
      <h4>Visual Design System</h4>
      <p>One of the most important elements to the web app's design system is the
        usage of color. Color is used to highlight items that can be interacted
        with, and is used generously throughout the app. A crucial use of color is
        in denoting the different ways that a user can interact with passages and
        poems, while the yellow highlighting of text is used to denote UI elements
        that the user can interact with to navigate between screens in the app. I
        selected a palette of bright colors with a yellow <span id="tbYellow">
        (#f9e530)</span>, green <span id="tbGreen">(#80c342)</span>,
        blue <span id="tbBlue">(#3bc6ef)</span>, and a red <span id="tbRed">
        (#ed1f24)</span> for my colors.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
        <img src="image/tbd/vis1.png" />
      </div>
      <p>The selection circle is another central piece to the visual design. The user
        begins their poetic experience in Trubadour with a ranking of four passages
        select poems they resonate with. I wanted something that would be fun to
        interact with, even if for a simple a function as selecting passages.</p>
      <div data-anijs="if: scroll, on: window, do: fadeInUp animated, before: $scrollReveal">
        <img src="image/tbd/vis2.png" />
      </div>
      <p>To aid in the navigation of the different pages of the app, I also
        designed and implemented a tab system for navigation. A major part of the
        problem is making the multitudinous places to navigate within the tool
        compact and accessible. The idea was to make navigation seem deceptively
        simple, and so after categorizing different functions into different
        categories, I devised the tabbing system within the tool to make it easier
        to navigate what I classified as three main sections to the tool.
        The tabs are kept in a dock that is always visible over text, and
        corresponds with the section that they lead to in terms of both color and
        text alignment. The poem screen and tab are in an orange <span id="tbOrange">
        (#dd7f3c)</span>, the mad libs in a cerulean <span id="tbCerulean">(#6acad7)</span>,
        and the social tab and screen in a pink <span id="tbPink">(#cb7cb4)</span>.</p>
